# gridsome-starter-strapi

This is a Gridsome Starter using the headless CMS [Strapi](https://strapi.io). It is suppose to kick-start development.

Under the hood, the starter is using the source plugin [`@gridsome/source-strapi`](https://gridsome.org/plugins/@gridsome/source-strapi) to pull data from Strapi into Gridsome's data store. Furthermore, [`MVP.css`](https://andybrewer.github.io/mvp/) is used for basic styling.

## Strapi Setup

TBD

## Initial Setup
